  <h2 class='c010'>PREFACE.</h2>
</div>
<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>In</span> the Sunday newspapers of May 24, of
the past year, 1846, appeared the following
paragraph:—</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c001'>
    <div>MARYLEBONE.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c012'>A “<span class='sc'>Gent</span>.”—A respectable-looking man, named
James Dickenson, was charged by Brooks, 169 S,
who said, “Please your worship, at two o’clock
yesterday morning (Monday), I found this ‘gent’
drunk in Park Road, and took him into custody.”</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Mr. Rawlinson</i>: Who do you say you found
drunk?</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Constable</i>: This “gent,” your worship.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Mr. Rawlinson</i>: What do you mean by “gent?”
There is no such word in our language. I hold a
man who is called a “gent” to be the greatest
<span class='pageno' id='Page_vi'>vi</span>blackguard there is. (To the prisoner): What do
you say to this? I hope you are not a “gent.”</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Prisoner</i>: I am not, sir, and I trust that I know
the distinction between a “gent” and a “gentleman.”</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Mr. Rawlinson</i>: I dare say you do, sir, and I
look upon the word “gent” as one of the most
blackguard expressions that can be used.</p>

<p class='c013'>The prisoner was fined 5<i>s.</i>, which he directly
paid.</p>

<p class='c014'>We were exceedingly delighted when we
read this police report. We had laboured, for
three or four years, to bring the race of
Gents into universal contempt; and we at
last found that an intelligent and respected
London magistrate had publicly stated, from
the bench, his opinion of the miserable class
in question; and that it exactly coincided with
our own. But fearing—from seeing the odious
word still starting up in shops, ticketed to wild
<span class='pageno' id='Page_vii'>vii</span>articles of dress, to be hereafter alluded to, as
well as hearing it every now and then applied
by one “party” to another of his acquaintance—that
the species was not yet extinct; fearing
this, in spite of our direct attacks in <i>Punch</i> and
<i>Bentley’s Miscellany</i>, and our side-wind blows
through the medium of our esteemed friend
John Parry, certain burlesques at the Lyceum,
and various other channels—we determined
upon reconsidering all we had ever propounded
on the subject, and publishing it in the form
now presented to the reader, that all might
clearly see who the Gents were, and shun them
accordingly.</p>

<p class='c015'>And so we leave our little book in your
hands, published at a price, as a prospectus
always says, “that will bring it within the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_viii'>viii</span>reach of all classes.” And we request your
co-operation towards the great end of putting
Gents out altogether. For they form an offensive
body, of more importance than you would
at first conceive; and both public and private
society will be much benefited by their extinction.</p>

</div><p class='drop-capi1_1'>
<span class='sc'>The</span> species of the human race,
to the consideration of which
we are about to draw the
attention of the reader,
is of all others the most
unbearable, principally from an assumption of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2'>2</span>style about him—a futile aping of superiority
that inspires us with feelings of mingled contempt
and amusement, when we contemplate
his ridiculous pretensions to be considered
“the thing.”</p>

<p class='c015'>The Gent is of comparatively late creation.
He has sprung from the original rude untutored
man by combinations of chance and cultivation,
in the same manner as the later varieties
of fancy pippins have been produced by the
devices of artful market-gardeners, from the
original stock wild crab of the hedges. The
fashion which Gents have of occasionally addressing
one another as “my pippin” favours
this analogy: and when they use this figure of
speech, they pronounce it as follows,—placing
great stress on the first letter, and then waiting
awhile for the rest,—“Ullo, my P—ippin!”</p>

<p class='c015'>After much diligent investigation, we find
no mention made of the Gent in the writings
of authors who flourished antecedent to the
last ten years.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_3'>3</span>In the older works we meet with “<i>bucks</i>”
and “<i>gay blades</i>” and “<i>pretty fellows</i>;” and
later with “<i>men upon town</i>,” “<i>swells</i>” and
“<i>downy ones</i>,” or “<i>knowing coves</i>:” but the
pure Gent comes not under any of these orders.
He was not known in these times. He is
scarcely understood now so universally as we
could wish; but we trust that his real character
will, before long, be properly appreciated.
He is evidently the result of a variety of our
present condition of society—that constant
wearing struggle to appear something more
than we in reality are, which now characterizes
every body, both in their public and private
phases.</p>

<p class='c015'>Our attention was first called to the Gents in
the following manner:—</p>

<p class='c015'>We were in the habit of occasionally coming
into contact with certain individuals, who when
they spoke of their acquaintances were accustomed
to say “I know a Gent,” or, “A Gent
<span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>told me.” Never by any good luck did we
hear them speak of Gentlemen. But it occurred
that we chanced, on future occasions, to
see one or two of the Gents above alluded
to, and then we understood what they were.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id005'>
<img src='images/i004.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c015'>The first Gent we ever saw, we encountered
on the roof of an omnibus, with his hat a little
on one side, and a staring shawl round his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>neck. He was also smoking a cigar, as he sat
next to the driver, in order that he might reap
the benefit of his anecdotes and remarks concerning
the horses and vehicle, to which the
Gent replied at intervals, “Ah,” and “Yes,”
and “I should say not,” and “Just so,” with
other similar phrases used to fill up unmeaning
dialogue. We heard him speak of “a Party
he knew,” and he was very much interested at
hearing that the off-horse worked “in the fust
bus as ever Shillibeer started, and was took
from the Angel to be put on the Elephant.”
He was also informed of the singular speculation
in which “the guvner give a fippun note
for that little mare, and was offered eight
sovrins for her within a week, though she was
a reg’lar bag o’ bones;” upon which the Gent
observed that “very often those sort of horses
were the best.” Having delivered himself of
which opinion, he rolled his cigar about in his
mouth, gave a whiff in our face, and then
<span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>removed it between his middle and ring-finger,
to offer it to another Gent on the roof, who
begged the favour of a light.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id006'>
<img src='images/i007.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c015'>The next Gent we met was in the street.
He wore large check trowsers of the true light
comedian pattern, which appeared to have been
made expressly for Mr. Walter Lacy, or Mr.
Wright: and he had on a short odd coat;
such a one as that in which Mr. Buckstone
might be expected to go to a ball. He carried
a little stick of no earthly use, with a horse’s
silver hoof on the top of it, which he kept to his
lips always; and he also patronised the staring
shawl and cigar; and he evidently imagined that
he was “rather the Stilton than otherwise”—“<i>Stilton</i>”
or “<i>cheese</i>” being terms by which
Gents imply style or fashion. He was pursuing
a pretty girl of modest deportment, who was
possibly going home—for it was evening, when
Gents and cheap umbrellas chiefly flourish—after
her hard day’s toil at a bonnet-shop. The Gent
<span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>had not the sense to see that his advances were
repulsed with scorn and indignation. He
<span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>imagined that by addressing his coarse annoying
gallantry to an unprotected girl, he was
acting as if he was “upon town,” “a fast
man,” “up to a thing or two,” or some other
such epithet, which it is the ambition of the
Gent to get attached to his name.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id005'>
<img src='images/i009.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c015'>We met the next Gent in the boxes at one
of the theatres, whither he had come in the
full-dress of a light blue stock, and cleaned
white gloves re-dirtied. We knew they had
been cleaned; they exhaled a faint camphine
odour, as he put his hand on the brass rail and
leant over us, and there was none of that sharpness
of outline in their dirt which new gloves
evince: it was denser, cloudier, more universal;
and the knuckles and nails were remarkably
so. This Gent also had a little stick.
He lighted a cigar at the lobby-lamp on
leaving the house, and pulled a staring shawl
out of his hat as he whistled an air from one
of the burlesques. He went over to the Albion,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>the room of which was quite full; and after
standing in the centre for a few seconds—tapping
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>his teeth with his stick, whilst his left
hand was thrust into the hinder pocket of his
coat, dragged round to his hip—apparently
disgusted at not creating any sensation, he
turned round on his heel, and crossing Covent
Garden, ultimately dived into Evans’s.</p>

<p class='c015'>Then we thought that the Gents must be
a race by themselves, which social naturalists
had overlooked, deserving some attention; and
we determined to study their habits, and allot
to them a certain position which at that time
they did not appear to have.</p>

<span class='sc'>Experience</span> proves that
pictures are the best
media for conveying information
at the outset
of tuition. Hence,
in the study of Natural
History, for
instance, tyros learn the animals with their letters:
their hornbooks have zoological alphabets,
coloured in tints more or less eccentric; and,
although led away by the representations, they
sometimes read “A for donkey, B for great
cow, C for poor puss,” yet, on the whole, the
way is a good one.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>So, we will teach those not yet well up in the
manner, by pictures, how they may know the
Gents.</p>

<p class='c015'>The finest specimens may be seen in the
coloured “Fashions,” with which certain comically-disposed
tailors adorn their windows. In
these presumed representations of prevalent
style, some favourite west-end locality is taken
for the background; and, in front, are many
Gents, in such attitudes as may display their
figures and little boots to the best advantage.
Some are supposed to be arrayed for an evening
party, in green dress-coats and puce tights.
Some, again, are represented as sportsmen,
with pinched-in waists, that the shock of the
first leap, or the kick of the first shot, would
knock in half; and others are promenade Gents,
in frock coats and corded trowsers, bowing to
one another with much grace, or leading little
Gents by the hand, who look like animated
daguerreotypes of themselves. Well, then,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>these are Gents, <i>pur sang</i>. Observe, as the
showman says, observe their fashionably-shaped
hats, their Lilliputian boots, their tiny gloves.
There is no deception. Observe that all their
positions are evidently the result of much study;
and that the greater part of them have one arm
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>elevated, and the palm open, with the air of a
conjurer when he says,—“You will perceive I
have nothing in my hand.”</p>

<div  class='figcenter id005'>
<img src='images/i013.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c015'>Of the same family as these Gents, are the
fashionable loungers in pantomimes, who walk
about with the distinguished females in the
scanty <i>visites</i> of pink glazed calico, trimmed
with ermine; and the lovers in the blue coats
and white trowsers on the sixpenny valentines,
who direct the attention of the adored one to
the distant village church.</p>

  <img class='drop-capi' src='images/i015.jpg' width='300' alt='' />
</div><p class='drop-capi1_1'>
<span class='sc'>One</span> has only to
look into the advertisements
of
cheap tailors, and
the windows of
ticketed shops, to
form a very good
notion of the
other principal
marks by which
the Gent may be distinguished.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>It should be borne in mind, that the main
object of the Gent is to assume a position
which he conceives to be superior to his own.</p>

<p class='c015'>Now this, he fancies, is in a great measure
accomplished by out-of-the-way clothes—a
mark of superiority which has the advantage
of requiring but a small outlay of intellect;
and cunning manufacturers invent things on
purpose to suit this taste, as the men of Manchester
export gay-coloured, large-figured patterns
for the negroes.</p>

<p class='c015'>For him the cheap Tailor announces the
“Gent’s Vest”—which is the Hebrew for
“Snob’s Waistcoat”—as patronised by the
nobility. To catch his eye alone, are the
representations of men of <i>ton</i> put at the side of
the advertisements; and, for his inspection, do
the dummies stand at the doors of the shops,
invested in the splendour of an entire suit, with
an impossible waist, “made to measure for the
same terms.”</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>And we may observe that the Gents usually
speak of their get-up as <i>the ticket</i>—the term
possibly being used in allusion to the badge
which distinguished their various articles of dress
when exposed for sale. And, in writing these,
the leaning of the Gents towards distinguished
associations is very evident. A great coat
must be a “Chesterfield,” a “Taglioni,” or a
“Codrington;” a little rag of coloured silk for
the neck is called a “Byron Tie;” and so on.
If the things are not dignified by these terms,
the Gent does not think much of them.</p>

<p class='c015'>To his taste does the ready-made Shoemaker
appeal in the short fancy <i>Alberts</i>,
ticketed “The Fashion.” If you are accustomed
to derive a little gratuitous amusement
from shop windows, as you go along the streets,
you will see in them the funniest things, meant
for the Gents, that it is possible to conceive.
The most favourite style of <i>chaussure</i> is a species
of cloth-boot, with a shiny-leather toe, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>a close row of little mother-of-pearl shirt-buttons
down the front; not for any purpose,
for they are simply sewn on, the real method
of fastening on the brodequin being by the
humble lace and tag of domestic life, at the
side.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id005'>
<img src='images/i018.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c015'>But it is with the Haberdashers that the
toilet of the Gents comes out strongest.</p>

<p class='c015'>You will see “Gents’ Dress Kid” ticketed in
the window. Be ye sure that they are large
sized, awkwardly cut, yellow kid gloves, at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>one-and-sixpence. The tint is evidently a
weakness with the Gents, who think them
dashing, and say they come from <i>Hoobegongs</i>.
But the merchants, lacking discrimination, believe
that the predisposition is general. We
will wager a dozen pairs of them that you
never went into one of these establishments,
and simply and decidedly demanded a pair
of white kid gloves, but you were immediately
asked “if you would not prefer straw-coloured?”</p>

<p class='c015'>And then the stocks—what marvellous
cravats they form! Blue always the favourite
colour—blue, with gold sprigs! blue, with a
crimson floss-silk flower! blue Joinvilles, with
rainbow ends! And, if they are black and
long, they are fashioned into quaint conceits:
Frills of black satin down the front, or bands
of the same fabric looking like an imitation of
crimped skate; or studs of jet made like
buttons, as if the Gent wore a cheap, black
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>satin shirt, and that was where it fastened.
And the white stocks are more fanciful still.
They are not very popular in their simple
form; for the Gents feel that they cannot help
looking like waiters in them; and so a little
illegitimate finery is necessary. Hence they
have lace ends, like the stamped papers from
the top of <i>bon-bon</i> and French plum boxes.
And the effect in society is very fine.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id007'>
<img src='images/i021.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c015'>The Jewellers consult the Gents, and for
them manufacture various dashing articles in
electro-gold. Some of the ornaments for the
cravat are like large white currants, with gilt
eels twisting round them; and others like
blanket-pins with water on the brain. We
have also seen some sporting Gents—of whom
we shall hereafter speak—with mosaic gold
heads of horses and foxes stuck in their stocks.
And they love rings in profusion, which we
have seen them at times wear outside their
gloves. But this, perhaps, was an advantage,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>as Gents are accustomed, in general, to wear
their hands large and red, with flattened ends
to the fingers.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id007'>
<img src='images/i022.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c015'>It is for the Gents to buy, that the print-sellers
put forward those dreary pictures of the
<i>Pets of the Ballet</i>; consisting chiefly of chubby
young persons, in short petticoats and ungraceful
attitudes, like nothing ever seen on the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>stage anywhere; and coloured lithographs of
housemaids cleaning steps; and chambermaids
with flat candlesticks in their hands; and
women with large black dots of eyes and heavy
ringlets, trying on shoes. One was very popular
a little time ago. It represented a young
lady something between a hairdresser’s dummy
and a barmaid, with a man’s coat and hat on
over her own dress. She was looking through
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>an eye-glass at the top of a whip, and underneath
was written “<i>damme!</i>”—why, or wherefore,
or in what relation to the singular mode
of toilet she has adopted, or what the word
itself meant in the abstract, we never could
make out. But the Gents seemed to know
all about it, and bought the picture furiously.</p>

<p class='c015'>By the tokens above mentioned—including
always the staring shawl and the <i>al fresco</i>
cigar—you may know the Gent when you see
him, even if you met him on the top of Mont
Blanc—a place, however, where you are not
very likely to encounter him. He prefers
Windmill Hill.</p>

<span class='sc'>When</span> the Promenade Concerts
usurped the place of the
regular Drama at our
theatres, and Kœnig and
Musard occupied the places
of Kean and Macready—when
Juliet was neglected
for Jullien, Prospero for Prospère, and
Viola for the violins, the Gent was exceedingly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>gratified thereby. The Promenade became his
Paradise; and he used to walk round and
round, keeping his face towards the audience
(admiring the young ladies in the dress tier),
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>with the pertinacity of the grand banners in
stage processions; which, painted only on one
side, appear to be endowed with some heliotropic
principle, that causes their emblazoned
surfaces to revolve always on the same plane
with the footlights. But, whilst the Gent
conceived that he was here “doing it—rather,”
in the railway trowsers and dazzling stock, he
totally forgot that the true <i>flaneur</i> would appear
in something like evening costume, although he
might not altogether adopt the extreme <i>rigueur</i>.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id004'>
<img src='images/i025.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c015'>We were rather inquieted as to what the
Gents would do when these concerts closed.
We made great search, and found at length
that the majority emigrated to the musical
taverns, where they contrived to get through
the evening under the combined influence of
Bellini, bottled beer, and brandy-and-water;
deriving additional excitement from the novelty
of seeing Somnambula performed through a
haze of tobacco-smoke.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id004'>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>
<img src='images/i028.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c015'>But the theatre proper, is a favourite resort
of the Gent, and half-price to the boxes his
usual plan of patronising it; more especially
when there is a ballet. Of the different parts
of the house he prefers the slips. If you are
seated opposite, you will see him come in about
nine o’clock, and, leaving the panel door open,
he stands on the seat, with his hands in his
pockets, his stick under his arm, and thus
makes his observations. Presently getting disgusted
at the want of respect shown to him by
an old gentleman in front, who is watching the
performance most intently, with his head reclining
on his arms, which are again supported
by the rail, and who requests that he will have
the goodness to shut the door, the Gent walks
grandly away, and goes round to the other side,
evidently conceiving that his dignity has been
hurt. Here the same process of observation is
repeated; and, if the Gent sees a pretty girl in
a private box, he stares unflinchingly at her,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>until he thinks he has made an impression.
And this is a strange lunatic notion with Gents
of every degree: they believe they have powers
to fascinate every female upon whom they cast
their eyes, never thinking of the utter contempt
always excited by such obtrusiveness on
the part of an entire stranger.</p>

</div><p class='drop-capi1_1'>
<span class='sc'>By</span> the following
signs may the
Gent at this period
be known:
He walketh six
abreast under the
Piazza, singing a
negro air in chorus;
and, perchance, danceth a lively measure
to the <i>refrain</i>, until he arriveth at the entrance
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>of Evans’s Grand Hotel. He descendeth the
stairs, and, on entering the room, he goeth to the
upper end thereof; and, having greeted the singers
with a wink, calleth out “Charles!” No response
being made by the waiter, he rappeth with
his stick upon the table, until the peppercastor
falleth on the floor; for which unseemly conduct
Evans mildly reproveth him. He taketh
a sight at Evans in return, when he can do so
unobserved, and saith that he liketh him not so
well as Rhodes: and then he calleth “Henry!”
Being served with the rabbit of Wales, he
saith to the funny singer,—“How are you, old
feller!” and presseth him to partake of his
grog. He proffereth a prayer that the funny
singer will oblige him with a particular song.
The funny singer complieth; and the Gent
singeth the chorus, prolonging it far beyond
the proper length, to the indignation of Evans.
At its conclusion, his animal spirits and enthusiastic
approbation impel him to call out—“Bravo,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>Rouse!” which promoteth political
dissension amongst the guests. Evans telleth
him “that he cannot have the harmony of the
room disturbed by one individual”—a sentiment
which the Gent applaudeth lustily, and
ordereth some champagne, which he drinketh,
with the singers, from a tankard. The anger
of Evans is in a measure appeased. The Gent
joineth in a glee at the wrong time; but turneth
away wrath by buying a copy of it when
finished. He ordereth more champagne, and
believeth that he is taken by the room for a
“Lord about town.” He saith he hath a pony
that he will back against every other to do
every thing. He talketh of actresses, and
winketh mysteriously. He telleth the funny
singer that if he will come and see him at his
little place in the city, he will put him up to a
thing or two. At last he getteth troublesome,
and is coaxed away by his companions. The
next morning he saith what a spree he had, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>that he sat opposite to an officer who knew one
of the ballet, and had spoken to her once behind
the scenes; and so he thinketh that he
hath a link with the great world. But yet,
upon reflection, he hath not.</p>

<span class='sc'>The</span> most popular lounging
thoroughfares of the west-end,
such as Regent Street,
the Burlington Arcade,
Bond Street, or Piccadilly,
are not those in
which the Gents are to
be often encountered in the day-time. The majority
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>of them have evidently occupations, which
keep them somewhere until four or five o’clock,
so that they never come out in their full force
until dusk, except on holidays; and then
the short steamboats are the best places
to find them. In fine weather, they discard
the staring shawl for a blue handkerchief,
with white spots; and then they provide
themselves with a cigar (the cigar again!), a
bottle of stout, and a Sunday paper, and, from
the edge of the paddle-box, or from the top of
the cabin, defy the world. You can find out
their locality by the vapour of the cigar, as the
“smoke which so gracefully curled” showed
the author of “The Woodpecker” that he was
in the vicinity of a cottage. If you cannot
discover them by this sign, you must look
out for their studs—they have a great idea
of studs—usually like blue raspberries, which
you will find glittering in the sun. If, by
chance, they wear a long stock, then they have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>two pins and a chain; but such pins! and such
a chain! You can never see any thing like
them, unless you go to the Lowther Arcade;
and there, amongst those wondrous collections
of ornamental and useful articles which strew
that thoroughfare—for all the houses appear to
have turned themselves and their contents out
of the window—you will find similar ones;
meant, however, if we mistake not, for the
back plaits of ladies’ hair. And this reminds
us that the Lowther Arcade is a favourite
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>lounge with the Gents: it is possible that, from
the glittering stores here displayed, they acquire
their taste for jewellery. The Lowther
Arcade is to the men in the city chambers
what the Burlington is to the denizens of the
Albany. It is, as it were, the frontier between
the two hemispheres of London life, to which
position it lays some claim, inasmuch as when
very crowded, a personal examination of effects
sometimes takes place on passing it. And
great is the throng here of an afternoon, principally
composed of Gents and seedy foreigners,
walking up an appetite for the incomprehensible
carte of Berthollini; or a doubtful cross between
these two varieties of the human species,
found, upon investigation, to be attached to
billiard-tables. And, by the way, remember,
that of all the scamps upon town, your billiard-table
<i>habitués</i> are the darkest. Here they walk
up and down for hours, loading the air with the
products of combustion from their cheap cigars,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>(cigars again!) puffing the smoke into every
bonnet they meet, or standing at the entrance
with a whip in their hands, as though they had
just got off their horse, and were keeping an
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>appointment. But in reality they have no
horse, nor do they expect any body.</p>

</div>

<p class='c015'>There are several loungers at this part of
the town, who belong neither to the race of
Gents nor Foreigners, and certainly are not
military, although they evidently wish to be
considered so; to whom we may briefly allude;
for they partake, in a slight degree, of the
characteristics of the former. They wear
mustaches and curious frock-coats, sometimes
with dabs of braid about them. Their hair is
wiry and dark, and they are constantly arranging
it with their hands. Sometimes they
are seen with spurs; occasionally they carry
a black cane, shouldered like a gun, twisted
round their arm, with its head in their pocket,
held upside down, in any way but the normal
one. Day after day, when it is fine; nay,
year after year; there they are, true <i>batteurs
de pavé</i>. You may follow them for hours, and
you will never see them speak to, or recognised
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>by, any body. They do not even commune
with each other. Nobody knows them;
they belong to no club, and are never seen
anywhere else. And it is remarkable that,
like butterflies, you only come across them in
bright weather. Where they go to at other
times we cannot tell; we shall never be able
to do so, until we have solved two other similar
enigmas with respect to pins and bluebottles;
and their ultimate destination is, to our thinking,
the greatest marvel of the present day.
For the corpses of the latter, found in grocers’
windows and saucers of unacknowledged poisons,
and the rusty remains of the former discovered
between boards, bear no comparison to the
numbers that have existed. This disappearance
is as remarkable as the generation of the fine
woolly substance you find in the corner of your
waistcoat pocket, where you have only kept a
pencil-case and latch-key. But this by the way.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id004'>
<img src='images/i040.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c015'>We have said the Gent likes to be outside
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>an omnibus. But he also loves the roof—literally,
the roof; and he almost rejoices when
he finds that the box is full, and he is obliged
to perch there; for his mind appears to be
brightened by his position, and many eccentricities
are induced. He nods to other passengers
as they pass, in a familiar manner,
causing them to puzzle themselves almost into
insanity during the remainder of the day, in
endeavours to recollect who he could have
been. He winks at the elder pupils of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>promenading Hammersmith academies, if on
their road; and tells old ladies, when they get
out to go away, to give his love at home, and
that he will be sure to write to them. He
also has a cigar here, and he offers one to the
coachman and other passengers. Before stages
were exterminated the Gent preferred the
box just the same; indeed, he felt in a measure
degraded if he could not get it; and
when the coachman got down he liked to hold
the reins and whip in the proper manner, and
show people that he was perfectly used to such
a thing, and, for aught they could tell, might
have a four-in-hand of his own.</p>

<p class='c015'>A variety of this last style of Gent, whom
we may call the Driving Gent, has lately come
up about town. We were in the Strand the
other afternoon, and suddenly heard some notes
from a post-horn, very badly blown; upon
which we looked round, and saw a dog-cart approaching,
with two horses to it, driven tandem
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>fashion, with ferret-bells on their bearing reins.
On this dog-cart were four Gents—not two
gentlemen and two servants, as might have
been expected. They were all dressed nearly
alike; hats with narrow brims, coats with
large buttons, staring shawls, and trowsers
of the most prominent style—very <i>loud</i> patterns,
as a friend appropriately called them.
Three had cigars, and the other had the horn;
and it was evident that they thought they were
“doing the fast thing, and no mistake.” We
saw them afterwards in the Park, and chanced
to follow them for some distance. The whole
time they were there they never exchanged a
salute with a soul—evidently they were out of
their sphere; but went round and round,
looked at by every body with something between
a stare and a sneer, until they drove off
again. The last time we saw them, they were
shaking hands with a fighting man at the door
of a gin-shop.</p>

<span class='sc'>The</span> Gent who goes
to the races must
not be confounded
with the Sporting
Gent, of whom we
may speak by-and-by.
He knows nothing in the world about the
running, nor indeed does he care much about
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>it, beyond the manner in which it may affect
a chance he has in a “Derby Sweep.” But he
thinks the fact of being seen there gives him
a position in society, and he would not miss
the races for any thing.</p>

<p class='c015'>As the Gent who goes to the races is closely
allied to the Gent we saw at the night taverns,
we will describe him in the same fashion.</p>

<p class='c015'>He buyeth a “D’Orsay blouse,” which he
believeth to have been made under the Count’s
own eye; a blue cravat, spotted with white
wafers; a whip, and a pair of short patent
boots, to produce an effect; in which he
mounteth a “fast four-horse coach” from the
“Garrick’s Head.” At the “Elephant and
Castle,” being called “my noble sportsman”
by the vender of the cards, he buyeth one, and
conceiveth that he is taken for Lord Chesterfield.
He asketh the vender, with a severe
look, “if it is Dorling’s?” to show that he is
“a downy cove,” and not to be done. He
<span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>also hath a glass of pale ale. On Clapham
Common he seeth a ladies’ school, and boweth
to the tall pupil; whereupon the tall pupil
receiveth a chiding from the English teacher
for unseemly levity, and the tall pupil accuseth
the half-boarder of being the true culprit. At
Mitcham he hath another pale ale, and delighteth
in being recognised by a man on a
pony, whom he sayeth is “Bob Croft;” after
which, he winketh or kisseth his hand to all
the housemaids, who, on the Derby Day, invariably
take two hours and a half to make the
front-room bed; swinging his legs over the
side seat of the roof, that his boots may dazzle
the rustics. At Sutton he hath another pale
ale. This fully openeth his heart, and he
carolleth lustily until he reacheth the Downs,
when he hopeth to be taken for one of the
Guards. A gipsy woman telleth him that he
hath a wicked eye, and that his company is
agreeable to various female Christian names;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>whereon he giveth her a shilling and the tail of
a lobster, the large claw of which he putteth
to his nose, and in his imagination doeth the
“fast thing.”</p>

<div  class='figcenter id004'>
<img src='images/i047.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c015'>After the race (than which he sayeth he
never saw a better, albeit he hath seen but
few) he thinketh it “nobby” to throw at the
sticks, and insisteth that the merchant do set
up a bell, a feathered cock, and a pear that
discourseth music most unhappily, by pulling
out the stalk, and blowing through it. He
seeth Lord ——, whom he knoweth by sight,
next to him, laden with crockery, dogs, and
Napoleons, pincushions, money-boxes, and
soldiers in remarkable uniforms, partaking of
the Grenadier’s, Highlander’s, and Turk’s;
and he striveth to knock down more things
than the patrician. But in this he faileth, and
intruding on the other’s aim, is called a
“snob,” which, in the kindness of his heart,
he resenteth not, but carrieth his winnings in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>his hat back to the coach, after which he
walketh about “to see the fine women.”
Next he hath more lunch, until his heart
openeth wider than ever, and he thinketh,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>“This is life rather; what a fast one I am,
and can’t I do it when I choose! Hurrah!”
He then challengeth strange men on the roofs
of distant vehicles to take wine, because he
knoweth “they are the right sort,” and
finisheth by trying a hornpipe on the roof of
his own, in all the enthusiasm of ale, sun, lobster
salad, dust, champagne, and a post-horn.</p>

<p class='c015'>Going home, his humour knoweth no
bounds. He tieth his handkerchief to his
stick for a flag, until he loseth his hat, when
he tieth his handkerchief round his head.
He sitteth on the post-horn, and causeth it to
resemble a ram’s. He pelteth old gentlemen
driving four-wheeled chaises with snuff-boxes,
and distributeth pincushions to the domestics,
breaking windows withal. He liketh to know
who any one is who upsetteth him by offensive
speech; and tumbleth to the ground at Sutton,
where he wisheth for several pale ales
while the coach stoppeth to cool the wheels,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>which follow the example of the passengers,
and begin to smoke. Here he danceth a lively
measure in the road before a landau, and
smileth wickedly at the occupants. Getting
troublesome, he is put in the inside, with the
helper, the hamper, and the dirty plates, where
he remaineth until he reacheth London, when
he sayeth, “Let’s make a night of it.” But
the manufacturing process is scarcely worthy
the reader’s attention. The next day he sayeth,
“I must dine at Berthollini’s for two months
to come, and give up suppers.”</p>

</div>
<div class='c014'>
  <img class='drop-capi' src='images/i050.jpg' width='300' alt='' />
</div><p class='drop-capi1_1'>
<span class='sc'>Once</span>, when like Mr.
Tennyson we were
“waiting for the train
at Coventry,” and
thinking of Lady Godiva—the
Gents would
like to have peeped at
Godiva—we saw a
penny show on the
ground floor of an empty house in a principal
street of that good city. It consisted
<span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>of “A Happy Family”—a collection of various
animals, of different natures, in one cage—like
the travelling menagerie opposite the National
Gallery, but on a much larger scale. The
members of the “family” were quietly enjoying
the pleasure of each other’s society, with the
exception of two monkeys, one of whom sat
sullenly scowling at some mice, as he hugged
himself up into a ball in every body’s way; and
the other created much discomfort, from time
to time, by rushing about in a frantic manner,
running over his neighbours, performing totally
useless feats of agility, and deporting himself
generally in an absurd and unseemly fashion.</p>

<p class='c015'>Now, taking monkeys to be the Gents of the
animal kingdom, we were pleased to see how
closely they resemble their human brethren:—for
the Gents you encounter in society are of
two kinds. Taking an assembly as the place
where you would be most likely to come upon
them, you will find them either endeavouring
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>to “do the grand,” by not joining in the current
amusements of the evening; or overstepping
all bounds of ordinary behaviour—“going it,”
to use their own words—and committing every
kind of preposterous and silly offence against
the received rules of society.</p>

<p class='c015'>If you talk to the first of these, whom we
may call the dreary Gent, you will always find
that he has been “dining with some fellows he
knows;” or “having a weed with a man;” and
you will be reminded of cigars. He affects a
drawling indifferent tone of voice, which he
considers cool and fashionable; and he prefers
keeping outside the drawing-room door, upon
the landing, because “he don’t want to be bored
to dance.” He wears broad tails to his coat,
and most probably the buttonholes are brought
together over his chest by a small snaffle; whilst,
hanging by a bit of chain from his waistcoat
pocket, is a little broquet key, made like a dog’s
head, the nose of which winds up his watch.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>His stock is of figured satin, very gay, and very
narrow, and with long twisted ends, in which
is stuck a large pin—usually a claw holding a
stone, as big and as white as a pea of Wenham
ice from a sherry cubbler. He will ask you, “if
you were up at Putney on Tuesday;” and if
you were not, and do not even know what great
event took place on that day, be sure that he
regards you with great contempt. Like all
Gents, he has a great notion of champagne,
which at supper he drinks by himself from a
tumbler as he would drink it at a night tavern,
as aforesaid, from a tankard.</p>

<p class='c015'>Very opposite to him is the joyous Gent,
whom we may term the Perrot of private life.
He always gives us the notion of a ballet-dancer
spoiled, especially in Pastorale or the Polka;
in which latter dance, if he does not happen to
have for his partner a young lady of determined
spirit, and a keen discrimination of right and
wrong, he will launch off into all sorts of toe-and-heel
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>tomfooleries, such as simple people
used to perpetrate when the Polka first broke
out—such as you may still see, after supper, at
Jullien’s and Vauxhall, or at the “Gothics,”
and other ten-and-sixpenny demi-public hops,
of the same genus, even at the Hanover Square
Rooms. The joyous Gent is very great indeed
in cheap dancing-academy figures. He knows
the “Caledonians” and the “Lancers;” he loves
the “Spanish dance,” and patronises the gloomy,
and almost extinct “Cellarius.” And we will
make any reasonable wager, that before the
quadrille begins, he will bow to his partner,
and then to the corner lady, or the one on his
left.</p>

<p class='c015'>The social acquirements of the joyous Gent
are many, and he delights in every opportunity
of exhibiting them. His strongest points are
his imitations of popular performers, especially
Buckstone, in whose manner he says, “well I
never!—did you ever!—oh never!—oh wlaw!”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>in a manner that elicits the loudest applause.
Next he attempts Macready, as follows:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c018'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Nay—dearest—nay—if thou—wouldst have—me paint</div>
      <div class='line in1'>The home—to which—could love—fulfil—its prayers,—</div>
      <div class='line in1'>This hand—would lead—thee—listen.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c019'>Then Mr. T. P. Cooke, when he pitches his
voice in a low falsetto, hitches his trowsers, says,
“My dear eyes! what! Sewsan!” and affirms
that “no true heart is altered by the gilt swabs
on the shoulders, but is ever open to the cry of
a female in distress.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Possibly the next will be Mr. Paul Bedford,
when he rolls his <i>r</i> and says, “Come along, my
r-r-r-r-rummy cove; come along comealong-comealong!
how are you? how d’ye do? here
we are! I’m a looking at you like bricksywicksywicksies—I
believe you my boy-y-y-y-y!”</p>

<p class='c015'>And directly afterwards he turns up his nose
with his forefinger, and looks like Mr. Wright,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>as he exclaims, “Come, I say you know, guv’nor,
none o’ them larks eh! you didn’t ought to
was.”</p>

<p class='c015'>All these are sure to be received with the
greatest enthusiasm: and as he usually gives
the name of the actor he is about to imitate,
before he commences, he is spared the unpleasantry
attendant upon the remark of some
guest, who says “Capital! famous! it’s Keeley
himself,” when the ingenious Gent is attempting
an impersonation of Farren.</p>

<p class='c015'>But after all his surest card is Buckstone.</p>

  <h2 class='c010'>CHAPTER IX.<br /> <br /><span class='c017'>OF GENTS ON THE RIVER</span></h2>
</div>
<div class='c014'>
  <img class='drop-capi' src='images/i057.jpg' width='200' alt='' />
</div><p class='drop-capi1_1'>
<span class='sc'>The</span> grand gathering of Gents is
only to be met with as one universal
réunion of all their varieties,
on board the Sunday
steamboats. No city in the
world produces so many holiday
specimens of tawdry vulgarity
as London: and the
river appears to be the point
towards which all the countless
myriads converge. Their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>strenuous attempts to ape gentility—a bad style
of word, we admit, but one peculiarly adapted
to our purpose—are to us more painful than
ludicrous: and the labouring man, dressed in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>the usual costume of his class is, in our eyes,
far more respectable than the Gent, in his
dreary efforts to assume a style and tournure
which he is so utterly incapable of carrying out.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id007'>
<img src='images/i058.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c015'>When joining a steamboat excursion the
Gent never sits on the regular benches placed
for that purpose. He prefers the top of the
cabin-door—the steps of the paddle-boxes—the
platform on which the steersman is elevated,
and the like situations. Here you may always
see him with a newspaper and a bottle of stout,
a light blue stock, and, being Sunday, a very
new hat, and a pair of white trowsers: with
Berlin gloves, which he carries in his hand.
For, indeed, not being used to them, nothing
presents so perfect an idea of tolerated discomfort
as a Sunday Gent in a pair of gloves.
We can only compare the appearance of his
hands, when suffering under the infliction, to
those of a Guy Fawkes, or the tailors’ dressed-up
dummies before alluded to.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id004'>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>
<img src='images/i060.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c015'>But there are also aquatic Gents, who row
in boats on regatta afternoons, and hope to be
mistaken for “Leanders.” Their principal
characteristics when on the river, in this phase,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>are propensities to wear pink silk jerseys, and
silk caps. Now and then they have been
known to row in white kid gloves. But they
may soon be detected; and are especially
found out by a race of amphibious aborigines
who affect the river and its banks, known to the
natives as “Coalies” and “Bargees;” and who
call them <i>tailors</i>, and make unpleasant allusion
to goose and board, whereupon the anger
of the Gents being called forth, they retort,
asking of the latter <i>amphibia</i> above alluded to,
“who eat the puppy pie under Marlow bridge?”
In which query, it is presumed, lies a hidden
taunt of rankling venom; for the “Bargees”
immediately indulge in language which would
shock any one of a properly constituted mind,
very dreadfully—and call the Gents <i>sweeps</i>,
not always without some adjective prefixed,
more powerful than polite.</p>

<p class='c015'>River Gents are very fond of talking of
their “rooms;” which means the rooms rented
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>by Oxford and Cambridge rowing men, for
their meetings previous to matches, starting,
&amp;c. With these, and the members of them,
the Gent professes to have an intimate acquaintance,
albeit most likely he never entered
them, and would in all probability be snubbed
out, or possibly kicked, if he made the attempt.</p>

<p class='c015'>Another great feature in the natures of the
river Gents, is that of belonging to four-oared
cutter-clubs, with startling names; such as,
the Argonauts, the Corsairs, &amp;c. They have
their boats very elaborately adorned—red and
blue; and lots of gilding being considered the
thing; with the arms of the club—the only
ones with which they have, in any way, any
thing to do—being emblazoned everywhere.
In such clubs the members row up to Putney,
dine, get drunk, sing out of window, and come
back in an omnibus, leaving their waterman to
bring the boat home the next day.</p>

<p class='c015'>The river Gent always knows a man with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>a yacht, with whom he has once been as far
as Gravesend. This enables him to talk about
the “Bargee;” and even when he thinks he
is entirely amongst the unsophisticated, to
launch into hazardous remarks about a “flying-jib,”
and the build of the <i>Prima Donna</i>. And
if he in any way intends to make a great effect,
he has been frequently known to take the name
of Lord Alfred Paget in vain; which is a great
thing, not only with river Gents, but all sorts
of city yacht men generally.</p>

</div><p class='drop-capi1_1'>
<span class='sc'>It</span> is probable
that, at some
time or the
other, you
have been at
a fête in
Paris.</p>

<p class='c015'>Because if
you have,
you will recollect
the gay “Bal de
Paris” that was lighted
up so tastefully when it
became dark. You will recall
the order that reigned
<span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>there, so different to the vulgar jostling
and dreary riot of the “Crown and Anchor”
at Greenwich Fair. If you have not
been there, figure to yourself an enormous
tent, say one hundred feet long, supported by
gilt pillars, with pretty festoons, and surrounded
by trophies and tricoloured flags, of red, blue,
and white calico all round. The floor is neatly
boarded; and in the centre, an excellent orchestra,
of a dozen musicians, performing all
the most popular quadrilles, waltzes, and polkas
of Paris. Five sous is charged for entrance,
and an extra demand of five sous is made each
time you dance; when you are not considered
as transgressing etiquette in asking any fair
one that your choice may fall upon. The
utmost order prevails. Indeed, the municipal
guards in attendance with their fierce mustaches
and tiger-skin helmets, will soon march
you off between them if you overstep decorum.</p>

<p class='c015'>With respect to the refreshments, there is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>not the immense bar which we see at the
Greenwich Fair and Moulsey Race-course
dancing assemblies, covered with cold boiled-beef,
ham, fowls, bottled-porter, pipes, and
crockery; but then there is a small tent aside
from the grand one, for lemonade, <i>sirop de
groseilles</i>, wine, coffee, and Rheims biscuits,
which has an air of refinement never met with
in England at meetings of this kind. Dancing
is the sole object of the company; and dance
they do; and so did we, too, once upon a time
(as soon as we got over our thorough English
idea that every body was looking at us), and we
can safely say we enjoyed ourselves much more
there than we had done at any dashing evening
parties in London. And then the practice in
French conversation which it affords! You
can speak so easily, so fluently, to a pretty
grisette in the middle of a dance, and under
the influence of a bottle of <i>vin ordinaire</i>, at
twelve sous; it beats all the masters, believe
<span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>us; and we speak from experience. But all
this by the way. All have their hobbies, and
pretty grisettes are ours.</p>

<p class='c015'>Few have watched these agreeable dances
without lamenting the absence of such things
from our English festivals: we believe it is
the Gents alone who have proved the obstacles
to their proper introduction. For they would
never keep quiet, and simply enjoy themselves.
They would think it necessary to “have a
spree;” and could not exist ten minutes without
surreptitiously lighting a cigar, for any
consideration. He would think that he was
not “nobby” if he did not have some wretched
champagne: and this miserable mess, getting
into his head, would lead him into all manner
of offensive behaviour. For no Gent can stand
much wine, at any time; and Gent’s wine in
particular, such as Casino champagne, fearfully
upsets them.</p>

<p class='c015'>When we first heard that M. Laurent was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>going to start a shilling concert and dance we
were much disquieted; for we knew at what a
rampant pitch Gentism would arrive there.
But it was somewhat gratifying to see that the
sensible behaviour of a few strong-minded
visitors somewhat awed them into propriety.
Still there are many who still assemble; and
the use of this chapter is, that you may be
shown how to know and avoid them.</p>

<p class='c015'>The Casino Gent especially likes a white
over-coat, short, with large buttons; and
under this he disposes a gay shawl, so as to
look like the collar of a waistcoat. He carries
a short stick, and this he never parts with
under any pretence; but in a polka you will
see it high in air above the whirling confusion
of dances, and by this signal may trace his
progress about the room.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id004'>
<img src='images/i069.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c015'>His polka is not of the first order; it
savours more of the dancing academy than
the drawing-room; and he has scarcely yet
<span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>given up the fandango atrocities before alluded
to, that disgraced the polka on its first introduction
into England. Hence you will at
times still see him “kicking up behind and
before” in an absurd manner, that “Old Joe,”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>of Ethiopian celebrity, could scarcely have outdone.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id004'>
<img src='images/i070.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c015'>This Gent is not very clever at the <i>deux
temps</i>. Before he knew what it was, he used
to imagine that certain fools were dancing the
polka to a waltz time; but now he has found
out his error, albeit he still looks upon it with
a sort of contemptuous expression, such as
unpleasant people in general adopt when they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>are called upon to admire something popular
that they cannot do themselves. In the
intervals of the dances he promenades the
room, laughing loudly about nothing particular,
and hitting his friends on the back with his
stick, to attract their attention. And no true
Gent, got up as we have described, ever entered
the Casino but he did not firmly believe that
he was <i>the</i> man of the assembly. Hence two
Gents will always look savage at one another
when they meet.</p>

<p class='c015'><i>Au reste</i>, the Gent is soon subdued, when
too lively, by the proper authorities: and he
has great belief in the power of an acquaintance
with Mr. Henry Mott, who delights in
elegant white cravats, and is the head master
of the ceremonies, nearest the band and the
sherry-cobblers.</p>

<p class='c015'>With respect to other public balls, you
will not meet many Gents at Weippert’s, or
the St. James’s. The men there are too strong
<span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>for them; not physically, but in social position;
and the <i>lorettes</i> of these assemblies have quick
eyes at detecting snobbishness of any kind.
We have seen one or two Gents at either
place; but they always looked especially
wretched—as much out of their place as a
toadstool in a conservatory. The gentlemen
did not insult them; they only tacitly objected
to be vis-à-vis to them, and quietly withdrew
their partners from the set, until the Gents
stood alone.</p>

<p class='c015'>They are in greater force at <i>bals masqués</i>,
in and out of costume. Many Gents conceive
that going in a scarlet coat and top-boots, and
now and then shouting “Yoicks!” constitutes
the fast thing: hence there is always one of
this kind. Others adopt large noses, and false
mustaches, which they think is “doing it—rather!”
But you never see them in characteristic
or original costumes; nor, lacking them,
do they even adhere to a recognised evening
<span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>toilet. They prefer their beloved railway
trowsers, and flaring stocks and shawls, and
centre all their notions of full-dress in a paletot.
M. Jullien is gradually changing all this:
we trust he will not stop until he places the
masked ball—“bal marsk” the Gent calls it—on
a level with those of Paris. But then the
complimentary admissions must be weeded;
and the authorities must learn that it is not
at all necessary to engage a few wretched
supernumeraries from the theatres, in dingy
wardrobe costumes, to support the festivity of
the evening. All low people, including Gents,
get drunk; and all drunken people are miserable
nuisances.</p>

<p class='c015'><i>Note.</i>—If ever you see two Gents dancing
together at a <i>bal masqué</i>, you are at liberty
to kick and insult them, with every opprobrious
epithet.</p>

</div><p class='drop-capi1_1'>
<span class='sc'>There</span> is a period in
the year of London
existence, when that
portion of it termed
the Season, <i>par excellence</i>,
comes to an end with every
body, whatever their station; for
very few there are who do not,
somehow or other, contrive to get
out of town, when the great rush
from home—that flight of the soul
of the departed Season—is at its height. Every
<span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>body who has not already gone, is going; nobody
will own to staying in town, even if compelled
to do so. Houses are shut up, blinds
newspapered, and furniture tied up in bags:
in fact, to make a wretched joke, whilst the
family is on the Rhine, its lamps and ottomans
are all in Holland. There are no more
carriages whirling about the west-end streets:
no more thundering knocks echoing all day,
and night, too, for the matter of that, in the
squares. You write letters, and get no answers:
you make calls, and find nobody at
home, but a servant on board wages, who runs
out into the area to look at you before she
answers the door, in great astonishment. You
think it almost disreputable to be seen about,
so you follow the rest, and go away.</p>

<p class='c015'>This feeling extends throughout all classes
of society: and going down lower and lower,
at last reaches the Gent, who copies the gentleman,
but sees, as usual, every thing through a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>wrong medium. In fact, his reflection is that
of a spoon, in more senses than one: making
the most outrageous images of the original,
distorting all the features, but still preserving
a strange sort of identity.</p>

<p class='c015'>The Gent has two favourite places of sea-side
resort, according to his idiosyncrasies: if
joyous, he goes to Gravesend; if dreary, to
Ramsgate. Margate is neither one thing nor
the other, and Brighton is really too respectable.
He cannot there show off: and to show
off is the battle of the Gent’s life. But Gravesend
is delicious. The transit is cheap and
rapid; the lodgings are moderate; an effect
in dress can be made at an easy rate; and,
above all, there is that largest ornamental
chalk-pit in the world, Rosherville.</p>

<p class='c015'>We are, perhaps, wrong in putting Gravesend
under the head of sea-side resorts: but
the Gent considers it to be so. And, indeed,
the baths there offer peculiar advantages,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>combining the properties of both fresh and
salt water, with the impurities of both, and
the attributes of neither. Yellow slippers
may also be purchased in the town; and this
circumstance induces the belief, that the neighbouring
water is the sea; a delusion which
appears common not only amongst the Gents,
but most of the settlers. This, however, by
the way: we were speaking of Rosherville,
the paradise which mainly draws the Gents
from town.</p>

<p class='c015'>The costume of the Gent at Rosherville
is analogous to the one he wears at the promenade
concerts, with the exception, that he
has a more airy cravat, of brighter hue, and
smokes perpetually, except in the ball-room; and
he would do that, thinking it was “the thing,”
if a board did not warn him: showing that
such warning was found absolutely necessary.
And here, whilst listening to the “military
band” of the first detachment of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>Light Coldstream Indefatigables, he puts his
hat on one side, sits on a table, and tapping
his short boot, which discovers its form through
his trowsers, with his equally curtailed cane,
believes, as usual, that he is <i>the</i> man of the
assembly.</p>

<p class='c015'>The Gent has several fashions in the dancing
at Rosherville, different from those of the
Casino. In the first place, he takes off his
hat, and hangs it on a peg, if there is one
vacant; if not, he leaves it at the bar. Then
he bows to his partner, and, if he knows her
very well, courts at the same time: and, subsequently,
he salutes the corners with great
politeness, previous to commencing the first
set. But this particular set does not stand
very high in estimation. In common with
other balls for the <i>basse classe</i>, its component
Gents prefer dances of intricate and abnormal
fashion: and so it is here also considered <i>ton</i>
to perform the <i>Caledonians</i> (which nobody ever
<span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>knows all through, except the master of the
ceremonies), the <i>Lancers</i>, <i>Spanish Dances</i>, the
<i>Cellarius</i>, even the <i>Gavotte</i>, and other frantic
arrangements of gasping professors, including,
of course, “<i>La Polka</i>” as it is always termed,
in their parlance. And on “Gala Nights,”
still more wonderful evolutions are gone
through, all of which are due to the inventive
genius of the aforesaid inimitable M.C.,
whose friendship the Gent especially prizes.
For at Rosherville that great man is to be seen—actually,
really to be seen—walking like an
ordinary person, amongst ordinary fellow
creatures. He is no longer a phantasy of
mental conception—not that zephyr in pumps
bounding amidst new-laid eggs and tea-things,
or matchlessly performing his Marine Hornpipe
in top-boots, or Chinese Fandango in
handcuffs, or Milanese Fling in the double
jack-chains; but a substantial reality,—the
glass of fashion, the mould of form, whom we
<span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>can never fancy putting off the pumps of
ceremony for the high-lows of necessity—in a
word, <span class='sc'>The Baron Nathan</span>.</p>

<p class='c015'>The Gent at Ramsgate would be the last
to persuade that it is really a dull place. He
is one of the most strenuous upholders of that
greatest of all popular delusions suffered to go
unchallenged, that English sea-side watering-places
generally are pleasant spots to emigrate
to, and Ramsgate in particular. We know, as
far as we are concerned, that we once underwent
transportation for seven days to that penal
settlement; and that we never before suffered
(we expect in common with every body else)
from such a ghastly gasping after the belief
that we were “doing a holiday,” as the Gent
would say, as during that time.</p>

<p class='c015'>How the Gent makes up his mind to go to
Ramsgate at all we cannot make out; but there
he always is: and he divides the measure of
his revelry thereat into four goes of excitement:
<span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>Going on the sands; Going out sailing; Going
on the pier; and Going to Sachett’s.</p>

<p class='c015'><i>Going on the sands</i> is the weakest of the
Gent’s pastimes: but he says, with a loud
laugh, that it is to see the ladies bathe. Elsewhere
it would be confined to watching children
bury one another in the sand, with small wooden
spades—a performance which, like a pantomime,
however interesting on first representation,
somewhat flags in interest upon repetition.
The Gent usually takes two chairs to rest upon,
and stares hard at every body else, especially
the females, the while he sketches feeble designs
with his short stick, which he never by any
means parts with, on the sand.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/i082.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c015'><i>Going out sailing</i> is also a slow business—slower
than a few friends after a dinner-party
for a carpet polka; or a standard five-act-play;
or a wedding breakfast; or the outside half of
yesterday’s <i>Times</i>; or a book written with a
“high moral purpose;” or a Charing-Cross-to-the-Bank omnibus—and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>that is saying a
good deal: the Gent, however, likes it: for
then he puts on a shirt ruled with blue ink, the
collar of which he turns down: and talks of
“jibs,” and “tacks,” and “sheets,” and also
alludes to the man he knows who keeps a yacht.
And he takes his cigar—his loved cigar—as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>soon as he leaves the harbour. And as he
leaves the harbour he stands in an attitude,
and believes that the young ladies who show
their ankles on the pier imagine him to be a
Red Rover.</p>

<p class='c015'>Perhaps <i>Going on the pier</i> is the Ramsgate
Gent’s greatest treat: because then he can put
on his gay clothes, and once more think that
he is rather the thing. But in this the Gent
makes a great mistake. He dresses but once
in the day, and then puts on a frock-coat,
which he wears to dinner, and all the evening;
not exactly understanding, we expect, what is
the real difference between morning and evening
toilets. For as Gentlemen usually dress after
a walk, so do Gents dress before one: and if
they do not appear in their “best” to walk up
and down the pier—which at Ramsgate is the
chief straw that the sinking <i>ennuyés</i> clutch at—and
stare superciliously at all whom they do
not know, they think they are snobs—the snob
<span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>being to the Gent what the Gent is to the
Gentleman.</p>

<p class='c015'>The prevalence of Gents at Ramsgate, in
such numbers that the fine weather brings
them out like bluebottles, is easily accounted
for. There is a certain class of families who
go to Ramsgate every year, because they were
there the last. They come either from the
Pancras-cum-Bloomsbury district of London,
or having shops, or ware-rooms, or counting-houses
in the City, live in suburban villas
comfortably off, and believing greatly in all
conventional rules of society, getting perhaps
once a year to the Opera, thinking a great
deal of Mansion-house balls, and believing to a
great degree in fashion-books. Well, these
good folks affect Ramsgate greatly, and so take
their families with them. The girls of this
class pass muster pretty well; Clapham or
Chiswick academies teaching them certain
school accomplishments, which pass current for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>a decent education amongst their equals—but
the boys are always Gents. The same feeling
which induces their parents to believe that the
more showily they can set out their dinner-table
the higher they rise in social life, makes
these sons imagine that two or three dear and
flashy articles of dress place them on a level
with the well-born and well-bred Gentleman.
Accustomed in their own spheres to take the
lead, they will not go where they meet men
who attain very good stations in society without
large studs or noisy-patterned cravats; and
constantly associating, one with the other, they
get lost beyond all redemption. And of these
is the migratory young-man society of Ramsgate
chiefly composed.</p>

<p class='c015'>Of the same class is the Gent at Boulogne.
He is at first a long time being persuaded to
go there; because he knows that his ignorance
of the language will be an awful drop to his
consequence, and bring him down at once to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>his elements in a very humiliating manner.
But after a while, finding that every body else
knows something about it but himself, he determines
to go. And in this wise doth he
deport himself.</p>

<p class='c015'><i>Imprimis</i> he alloweth his mustaches to
grow, which giveth him the look of an officer-lover
in a farce at the Eagle, but assimilateth
to the foreigner in nothing. He delighteth
in brutal conduct to the native functionaries,
which he taketh to be a fine display of national
spirit, and thinketh that they are impressed
with respect for him thereby. He calleth the
<i>vin ordinaire</i> “rot,” but drinketh brandy to
intoxication. He shouteth with hoarse joyless
laughter at French peculiarities, and thinketh
that, by so doing, he displayeth a fine-natured
<i>naïveté</i>. He deemeth the greatest discovery
ever made to be that of a tavern whereat
British stout is retailed; and thinketh that he
maketh a joke of excellent pungency when he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>saith “Waterloo,” to a French soldier. He
careth not for the indigenous hotels, but loveth
better the English boarding-house, where he
can have “a good John Bull joint, and no
French kickshaws:” John Bull being represented
generally as a vulgar top-booted man
verging on apoplexy, with, evidently, few ideas
of refinement, obstinate and hard-natured; but
the Gent conceiveth that upon occasions it is
ennobling to profess attachment to him.</p>

</div>
<div class='c014'>
  <img class='drop-capi' src='images/i088.jpg' width='300' alt='' />
</div><p class='drop-capi1_1'>
<span class='sc'>There</span> is a species of
Gent who, moving only
in a third or fourth rate
sphere, goes to a party
in a white cravat and
turned up wristbands,
and carries his
hat into the room
because he had
heard that Gentlemen
do so. He
is generally an
immense card.
We chanced to
stand next to a specimen of this kind, one
<span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>evening, in a quadrille, and the only remark
we heard him make was inquiring of his partner,
after two or three false starts, whether she
preferred dancing on a carpet or the bare
<span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>boards: to which the young lady replied,
having looked down to see what the floor was
(that she might not “put her foot in it,” figuratively
speaking), that she preferred a carpet, she
thought: and this was the beginning and end
of the conversation.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id007'>
<img src='images/i089.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c015'>A sample of this variety fixed himself upon us
once, as we were taking a stroll, merely upon
the intimacy of a casual party introduction two
or three weeks before, where we had procured
him some trifle at supper, solely because we
did not choose to run the chance of allowing
him to approach the table and stand near the
pretty girl over whose white shoulder we
stretched our arm to help him. We found out
that he was minutely particular about his deportment
in the street, and a pretty treat we
gave him. First of all we rattled our stick
against the area railings of the houses: then
we bought penny bunches of cherries at the
stalls, and munched them as we went along,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>continually pressing him to take some, or propelling
the stones, six at a time, along the
pavement in front of us. We cut off the angles
of all the squares, and ran very fast across all
the crossings; and then took off a little boy’s
cap, and carried it a short way with us, to provoke
a few salutations in our wake, of that
pleasing and forcible kind which only little
boys in the streets can give with such piquancy
of expression. We finally got rid of him by
insisting upon stopping at the corner of Berners
Street to see <i>Punch</i>—an exhibition we never,
by any means, omit playing audience to:
although we know many Gents who think their
station in society would be lost for ever, were
they once observed taking an interest in any
thing half so common.</p>

<p class='c015'>There is a peculiar race of Gents to be seen,
through the windows, lounging in tobacco-shops;
some leaning against the counter,
others seated on tubs, or occupying the like
<span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>positions. This employment is another variety
of what Gents think “fast.”</p>

<div  class='figcenter id004'>
<img src='images/i092.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c015'>The presiding goddess of this temple of
smoke is a scantily educated woman, who has
<span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>been more or less pretty at some time or
another; but still retains, it would seem, sufficient
attraction to draw the Gents about her.
Here they will pass hours, finding intense
pleasure in her commonplace uninteresting
conversation—retailing dull jokes, worn-out
anecdotes, or vapid inevitable puns to each
other; and staring at any casual purchaser who
may enter the shop, as if he were an intruder
on their domain.</p>

<p class='c015'>There are the Gents, also, who are afterwards
seen in the theatres at half-price: in the slips
during the performances, and in the saloon
during the <i>entr’acte</i>—the class who, whilst they
carry on brisk conversation and smart repartees
(of a sort) with the least reputable in public life,
form the vapid nonentities of private society
when females are present. They are men, to
use a phrase more expressive than elegant,
strongly addicted to <i>bear parties</i>—who think “a
glass of grog and a weed” the acme of social
<span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>enjoyment, and who look upon all entertainments
that throw them into the society of ladies,
or, indeed, any one of intellect and refinement,
as bores. They are the great men at the night
taverns, before alluded to. All that is, however,
harmless in its way; for the majority of those
houses are exceedingly well conducted: and,
indeed, it is only the Gents of the lowest sphere
who deem it spirited to mix themselves up, in
other resorts, with the ruffians of the ring and the
most degraded of either sex, in an atmosphere of
oaths and odours, where indecency is mistaken
for broad humour and dull slang for first-rate
wit.</p>

<p class='c015'>It is the cheap tailor who advertises, to whom
this style of Gent goes for his clothes. He is
caught by the poetry and the names of the
articles related; as well as of the establishment,
whether it be “Paletot Palace,” “the Kingdom
of Kerseymere,” or “the Walhalla of waistcoats,”
as it is termed in those small but lively works
<span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>of fiction thrown with such unsparing liberality
through the windows of railway omnibuses.
The following is an announcement peculiar to
the Frankensteins of these strange creations.
We have written it, and present the copy-right

adopt it.</p>

<span class='sc'>If any</span> influential member, bent
upon being of service
to his country, would
bring in a bill for the
“Total Repeal of the
Gents,” he would confer
the greatest benefit
on society; for
until they are entirely
knocked on the head, our public amusements
<span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>can never be conducted with the propriety
which distinguishes those of Paris.</p>

<p class='c015'>We believe, with sorrow, that this offensive
race of individuals is peculiar to our own country:
we know of no foreign type answering to
them. If persons establishing resorts where
they mostly congregate, could take out an assurance
against Gents, as they do against fire,
what a blessing it would be!</p>

<p class='c015'>We think it would be an excellent plan for
respectable electors to make members pledge
themselves to vote for the heavy taxation of
various articles in which Gents chiefly delight.
In this tariff we would have blue stocks; large
breast-pins; snaffle coat-studs; curled hair;
collar-galled hacks; Spanish dances; Cellarius
waltzes; Caledonian quadrilles; lithographed
beauties, plain and coloured; cheap cigars;
large pattern trowsers; gay under-waistcoats or
“vests;” thick sticks; short canes; walking-whips;
and boxes of omnibuses, as distinguished
<span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>from omnibus boxes. If the Gents could
not enjoy these things without paying heavy
prices for them they would go without; for a
great effect at a small outlay is the main intention
of all their follies.</p>

<p class='c015'>And we also think it might be serviceable
towards the great end of putting Gents out
altogether, when any one chances to say, “I
know a Gent,” to exclaim immediately either
“You know a <i>what</i>?” in accents of horror, or
“You look as if you did!” in a tone of contempt,
to bring him to a sense of his miserable position—in
whichever way you think will best work
upon his feelings.</p>

<p class='c015'>Doudney, Moses, Prew, and Hyams! patrons
as ye are of literature generally, and poets
especially! by whose influence the taste of the
Gents is in some measure guided, help us to
effect some little reform! Do not, we beseech
you, allow your emblazoned window-tickets to
lead this wretched race into such strange ideas
<span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>respecting the “fashions” as they are wont to
indulge in. Abolish all those little pasteboard
scutcheons which point out your gaudy fabrics
as “Novel,” “The Style,” “Splendid,” “The
Thing,” “Parisian,” and the like. Cut their
waistcoats, in charity, as if you intended them
for gentlemen instead of Gents. Reform your
own bills, and appeal not to the sympathies
with such wild innovations: and persuade the
literary Gent who writes those charming little
<i>brochures</i> about your establishments—whispered
to be the light contributor to Blackwood’s Magazine—which
are presented gratuitously with
the periodicals, to lead the minds of the Gents
into another channel. Let them no longer
imagine that the usual method of dressing
of an acknowledged leader of fashion—the
gentleman of the greatest taste in England—is
in a puckered six-and-threepenny blouse with
braid round the pockets (for such is the garment
that bears his name), a rainbow-tinted
<span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>stock, drugget-pattern trowsers, and nine-and-sixpenny
broad-brimmed hats. Do this, and
send all your present stock to America.</p>

<p class='c015'>Editors of Sporting Papers! you are renowned
for obliging courtesy: assist the good
work with your able pens, by never allowing
the term “Sporting Gent” to appear in your
columns, whether he undertakes to drive a pony
to death, match his dog to be torn to pieces
last in a struggle, or advance a pecuniary
inducement for two savages to pummel each
other’s heads to jelly. Did you ever see a
“Sporting Gent?” You must have done so;
and you have noted his coarse hands, his flattened
fingers, and dubby nails; his common
green coat, his slang handkerchief, and his low
hat: his dreary conversation entirely confined
to wiredrawn accounts of wagers he has
won, and matches he can make for any
thing. Never give him a chance of attaining
publicity, and he will go out and disappear
<span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>altogether, leaving the coast clear for
gentlemen.</p>

<p class='c015'>We are not altogether without a hope that,
by strong and energetic measures, the Gents
may be put down—this would be a real “improved
condition of the people” much to be
desired. A Court of Propriety might be established
at which Gents could be convicted of
misdemeanors against what is usually considered
<i>comme-il-faut</i>. And punishments might
be awarded proportionate to the nature of the
offence. For a heavy one a Gent might be
transported for fourteen days into good society,
where he would be especially wretched; for a
light one he might enter into heavy recognizances
not to smoke cigars on omnibuses or
steamers, not to wear any thing but quiet
colours, not to say he knew actresses, and not
to whistle when he entered a tavern, or, with
his fellows, laugh loudly at nothing, when ensconced
in his box there, for any time not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>exceeding the same period. A Court of
Requests would be of no use; for it is of little
avail requesting the Gents to do any thing.
Compulsion alone would reform them.</p>

<p class='c015'>We trust the day will come—albeit we feel
it will not be in our time—when the Gent will
be an extinct species; his “effigies,” as the old
illustrated books have it, being alone preserved
in museums. And then this treatise may be
regarded as those zoological papers are now
which treat of the Dodo: and the hieroglyphics
of coaches and horses, pheasants, foxes’ heads,
and sporting dogs found on the huge white
buttons of his wrapper, will be regarded with
as much curiosity, and possibly will give rise
to as much discussion and investigation as the
ibises and scarabæi in the Egyptian Room of
the British Museum. We hope it may be so.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright

so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project

and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away--you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or

must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg&#8482; License for all works

Gutenberg&#8482; License.

any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &bull; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid

</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT

PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone

accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>
